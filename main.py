# Practice: Positional & Keyword Arguments in Python


# POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
# Start by writing the code to create the three functions outlined below
# You'll use only positional arguments in the first three functions
# Test your code and correct any errors

# Greet The User
# Write a function that takes two parameters -- first name and age
# Use an f-string to welcome the user by first name and to display his/her age


# Area of a Rectangle
# Write a function to calculate the area (in square feet) of a rectangle
# Your two parameters will be length and width
# The print statement in the function should display the length, width and area (in square feet) of your rectangle

# Sum of Numbers
# Write a function that finds the sum of three numbers
# Your three parameters will be num1, num2, and num3
# The print statement in the function should display the sum of the three numbers



# KEYWORD ARGUMENTS
# Create the three functions outlined below
# In these last three functions, you'll use only keyword arguments 
# Test your code and correct any errors

# Greet By Title
# Write a function that greets the user by title, first name and last name
# Examples of titles include: Mr., Ms., Mrs. and Dr.
# When calling your function, change the order of your keyword arguments so that they don't match the order of your function parameters

# Describe Your Pet
# Write a function that says what type of pet you have and what your pet's name is
# Your function parameters will be pet_type and pet_name

# Updated Function
# Choose any ONE of the first three functions from this project and rewrite it below using keyword arguments
